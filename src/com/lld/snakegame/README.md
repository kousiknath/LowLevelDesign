## Design Snake game

1. The snake moves through a grid. The grid has food has some predefined 
cells. 
2. The snake's movement direction can be navigated by using "U", "D", "L", "R"
keys to move upwards, downwards, left and right side. 
3. Once the snake eats food in a cell, its size and game score, both increase. 
4. If the snake's head collides with its own body, the game is over. 
5. If the snake goes out of the boundary of the body, it wraps and appears 
from the opposite side. 
6. The game ends when all food items are consumed.
